# Class Exercise 2, Group: Diana, Heini & David

#Project description: 
Using the Guardian API we search all articles about the Balkan region and examine how often these articles discuss the topics of war and tourism. Finally, we assess whether the mentions of war and tourism have changed over time.

#Repository structure is as follows:

01 scraping: script that retrieves the data from the Guardian API

02 analysis: script that analyses the data and creates the visualisations

03 visualisations: a bar chart and a line chart that show the mentions of war and tourism over time
